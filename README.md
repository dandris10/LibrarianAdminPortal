Hello!
This is my attempt to solve the .Net challenge. You can clone this repository.
The database used is SQL, you have the migration files here too, so you can run them. (I believe you have to run each one of them)
I used PostMan to send the API calls, you can use it too.
The application follows a multi layer architecture.
What I added to the application was a new table in the database, called LendedBooks( which refferences the Books table), in which you can assign each book to a people( only a name, I did not create a separate table for users) and after that you can see all the lended books.

Thank you!
